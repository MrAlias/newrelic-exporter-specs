# exporter-specs

### Purpose
This repository houses specifications for various metric exporters.

### Organization
See the [Guidelines](Guidelines.md) for general principles on how to build exporters and 
provide adequate information so that they will be able to be queried by NRQL and visualizations can be created.


Each subdirectory contains a specification for a different metrics library.
